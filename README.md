# Google-Classroom-Apps-Script-Summary-Tool-using-Google-Sheets 

based on git template Classroom-to-Sheets - Integrate classroom details on Google Sheets ‚úÖ

The program is completely written from scratch.

```
    This script will have to run with the project owner as the person with the google classroom information.
    OR
    If you deploy it as a web app and run as the user option is selected and the user accepts the permissions then anyone can use it.

    See https://vanburen.brooklyncoop.org/google-classroom-history for an example of a deployed running application.

    The only thing that should be changed is the SHARE_EMAIL constant and you can set it to a parent's email address and anyone one's email address.

    Also this makes an assumption that homework is what we want to focus on.
    It also assumes that homework has "hw" or "homework" etc. in the title or it is due early in the morning.

    It is sad but true that google classroom or may be the administratiors do not clearly distinguish homework from classwork.

    Enjoy and feel free to modify, like, comment and subscribe!!!

    As always, we look forward to see what you can build!!!

const SHARE_EMAIL="PARENT-OR-OTHER-EMAIL-HERE"; // e.g., "parent@gmail.com"
```

## üí°Inspiration
* üìö Our son using google classroom and we want to help organize the home projects.

* üéì Still, we need to add upcoming assignments and certain class details manually.
