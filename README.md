# Classroom-to-Sheets - Integrate classroom details on Google Sheets ‚úÖ

## üí°Inspiration
* üìö Since the start of the Pandemic, Google Sheets have been the GoTo place for us students to maintain class schedules. Generally, the sheet is prepared by the Class Representative and then shared to the class.

* üéì Still, we need to add upcomming assignments and certain class details manually.

***

## ‚öôÔ∏è What it does?
Classroom-to-Sheets is a google script that connects the Google Sheet with the corresponding Google Classroom account and integrates assignments and class details.

### Features: 

* üë©‚Äçüè´ **Get Class Details**: It returns the classroom details along with the Class Teachers' details.

## Challenges I ran into üôÅ

‚ùóÔ∏èGetting Started with Google App Scripts: I came accrossing this amazing platform by Google recently and I found very less projects already made using it. So, it was tough to "*stackoverflow*" the doubts and I had to understand everything using the documentation. (Which is more than enough btw!)

‚ùóÔ∏èProviding Authorization: For a long time, the script was running on debugger but not on sheets. Lately, I found that authorization dosen't work with Custom Formulas, but with Custom Menu only. So I switched the complete code to Custom Menus.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of üòá

* I learnt a new tech this weekend and I'll definately use the product myself!

***

## What I learned ü§î

* **Google App Scripts**: I have understood the concepts and after creating this little product, I'm looking forward to create more complex scripts using it.

## What's next for Classroom-to-Sheets - Integrate classroom details on Google Sheets ‚úÖ

A lot of things can be done with this project.
* Formatting of the rows inserted.
